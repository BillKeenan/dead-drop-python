# dead-drop - now with more python
=========

Live at [dead-drop.me](https://dead-drop.me)

Secure text sender, generates a 1-time link and password. stores encrypted in mongo

The intention here is to be self contained, and operate all in browser to minimize attack vectors.

There is a sample Apache configuration, as well as a vagrant test environemnt.
